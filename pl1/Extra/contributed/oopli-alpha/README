INTRODUCTION
 
    This program is a precompiler that takes PL/I code with object oriented
    syntax and produces pure PL/I code. 

    See the INTRO.PDF document for a more elaborate introduction to both
    the concpets of Object Orientation in general, and OO PL/I in particular.

    See OOPLI-german.pdf for a presentation, once used in a training session.

    Note: You may find the introduction written in a somewhat peculiar
          style and tone. Please remember: that was written back in 1994 
          when OOP was not very widespread, at least not in my immediate
          environment. 

DIRECTORIES and FILES

    You will find the following directories:

    ./docs   all documents 
    ./bin    the OOPLI.cmd REXX precompiler, along with OOPLIRES.INC
             run-time include file, plus a sample makefile
    ./sample the sample project code
    ./sample-original    the original sample as a retrieved it from
                         the 1994-backup

    Note that the directory structure other than sample-original
    was created in 2006 in an effort to re-structure the project for
    more clarity

REQUIREMENTS

    The program is written in REXX and requires that you have a REXX
    interpreter installed in order to transform object oriented code
    into PL/I code. You need a PL/I compiler in order to produce an
    executable module.

COMPILING THE SAMPLE PROJECT
 
    You would need to put all of ./bin into the ./sample directory
    before you can continue. Then run make on the testoo.mak file
    in order to execute the commands necessary. This will build
    the TESTOO.EXE.

    NOTE: the ./sample-original/TESTOO.EXE is an OS/2 executable!
    
    WARNING: I have not tried to run this in 2005, so you might
             encounter errors all along.
    

NOTICE OF MOTIVATION

    This program was written in 1994 to run in OS/2 Warp and MVS TSO 
    environments. It has not since been modified, tested or maintained.
    It is contributed to the open source community in the hope that
    someone might find the idea of having an object oriented PL/I useful 
    and would adapt this code to run in a today's (2006) environment.

REFERENCES TO IBM LICENSE

    You will find referencese to IBM owning a copyright to this code. At
    the time of writing the precompiler (in my spare time), in 1994, I 
    was an employee of IBM in Switzerland. When I left IBM for another 
    job, I was granted upon my request full copy and usage rights by
    Swiss law, while IBM kept the same rights for themselves. Under the 
    agreement, IBM would retain the right to receive, upon request, and 
    use any updates that were made to the precompiler. I am now making 
    this available under the GNU GPL which is in full adherence to the 
    said agreement between IBM and myself.
